# Ariascode

A repository for my homework problem sets from a Numerical Computation course I took at Cornell University from Tomas Arias. The code uses C and Octave.

The course discussed various numerical computation techniques and eventually worked up to running Density Functional Theory calculations to predict energy level structures in non-Hydrogen atoms and simple molecules.
